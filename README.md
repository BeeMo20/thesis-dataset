# Thesis dataset
Here you can find all my data used for my thesis.

## Process
The data was collected by giving multiple source codes to the LLM named Gemini and ask if it could find any cyclic dependency in the given source code, each time with diffrent prompts.
Here are the prompts that I used:

## Promp 1

## Promp 2

## Promp 3

## Promp 4
